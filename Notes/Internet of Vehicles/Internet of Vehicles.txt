DSRC: IEEE 802.11p
	Dedicated Short Range Communication
	Increased Channel Rejection for out of channel interference
	Lesser Channel Bandwidth (10MHz) to account for environmental losses/echoes
		Reduces bandwidth and increases transmission time
	New managemnt frame for synchronization
	No authntication
		Exchanges data without establishing a basic service set(BSS), and thus no association and authentication procedures
		Use the wildcard BSSID in the header of the frames they exchange
		Security has to be taken care by the upper layers of the communication stack.
	Communication for relative speeds of 250Kmph. Typical range of 150-300m
	Around unlisensed 5.9GHz ISM band.
	Issues: 
		Connection Interruption
		Bandwidth shortage
		coverage limitaion
		Additional Infrastructure requirement

LTE: V2X Vehicle to Everything
	Need Global Synchronizaiton and Global systems
	More reaction time
	
Internet of Vehicles Applications: 
	Fleet Management
	Traffic Management
	Pollution Monitoring
	Safe Navigation
	Autonomous Vehicles
	Predictive Maintenance
Internet of Vehicles Challenges: 
	Different Data sources with different timing requirements
	Different QoS: different fulfillment delay and transmission data rates, etc
	Mobility:
		Harsh channel- Doppler, multipath fading, etc.
		Changing network topology
	Not enough bandwidth to support autonomous vehicles, rich infotainment media, etc
	Varying density of vehicles
	Coordination must be decentralized
	We need Interoperability: 
		Mulitple clouds, multiple services.
	Security: DSRC prone to attacks. Both V2V and in-vehicle network should be secure
	Privacy
	Reliability
	Safety: Always a priority

Sensor-less traffic management using genetic algorithms
Multi-Standard Gateway for Road Side Units
Multi-Applications support on common network infrastructure

What is cognitive access spectrum? 
	Dynamic spectrum managemnt.
